# dijkstra-visualization
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a road network. The algorithm is applied to a real-world map of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, using data from OpenStreetMap. The results are visualized on an interactive map using Leaflet.js.
