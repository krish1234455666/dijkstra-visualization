## **Project: Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization with Leaflet and OpenStreetMap**

### **Description**

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a road network. The algorithm is applied to a real-world map of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, using data from OpenStreetMap. The results are visualized on an interactive map using **Leaflet.js**.

The project consists of the following components:
1. **Python Script**: 
   - Fetches the road network of Kathmandu Valley using **OSMnx**.
   - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm using **NetworkX** to compute the shortest path.
   - Exports the explored nodes, edges, and the shortest path to a JSON file for visualization.

2. **HTML + JavaScript (Leaflet)**:
   - Loads the JSON file and visualizes the shortest path on a map.
   - Animates the exploration of nodes and edges using Leaflet.
   - Highlights the final shortest path between the start and end points with a glowing effect.

### **Features**
- Dynamic fetching of road network data from OpenStreetMap.
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm applied to real-world geographical data.
- Visualization using an interactive map with Leaflet.
- Step-by-step animation of node and edge exploration.
- Highlights the computed shortest path with a glowing effect.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For graph manipulation and algorithm implementation.
  - **OSMnx**: To retrieve and handle geographical data from OpenStreetMap.
  - **NetworkX**: For graph algorithms and shortest path computation.
  - **Heapq**: For priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - **JSON**: To store the output data for visualization.
  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**:
  - **Leaflet.js**: For map rendering and path visualization.
  - **AJAX**: To load the JSON data dynamically.
  - **jQuery**: For simpler DOM manipulation and AJAX calls.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

- Install Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install osmnx networkx matplotlib scikit-learn
  ```

- Ensure you have Python's built-in HTTP server or any other local server for serving the HTML file.

### **1. Python Script:**

The Python script fetches the road network from OpenStreetMap and applies Dijkstra’s algorithm. The output is stored in a `dijkstras_data.json` file, which is used by the HTML visualization.

- **To run the Python script:**
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

  This will:
  - Retrieve road data for Kathmandu Valley.
  - Compute the shortest path between two locations.
  - Export explored nodes, edges, and the shortest path to `dijkstras_data.json`.

### **2. Visualization (HTML + JavaScript):**

The HTML file contains a Leaflet map that visualizes the Dijkstra algorithm's execution. Since the file uses **AJAX** to fetch JSON data, it needs to be served through a local server.

#### **Run the HTML file on localhost:8000**:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `visualization.html` file is located.
2. Run the following command to start a simple HTTP server (using Python):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/visualization.html`.

The page will load the map and animate the Dijkstra's algorithm exploration on it.

### **How It Works**
1. **Start and End Nodes**: The script identifies the nearest nodes on the road network for the given latitude/longitude points and computes the shortest path between them.
2. **Exploration Animation**: The explored nodes and edges are animated on the map, simulating the exploration process of Dijkstra’s algorithm.
3. **Shortest Path Highlighting**: Once all nodes and edges are explored, the shortest path is highlighted with a glowing blue line.

### **Files**

- `dijkstra_visualization.py`: Python script to generate the JSON data using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `dijkstras_data.json`: JSON file generated by the Python script, containing the explored nodes, edges, and shortest path data.
- `visualization.html`: HTML file that visualizes the shortest path and exploration using Leaflet.
- `leaflet.css`, `leaflet.js`: Leaflet library for map rendering.
